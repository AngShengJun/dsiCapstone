# Part 1: Topic Selection

## Overview

This section documents the thought process on prelim sourcing to selection of topic for capstone. 

## Topics

Topics initially considered were on image classification, reason being I would like to try an new area in machine learning. However, there were considerations regarding the datasets for initial topics (see below). I have also considered the limitations of hardware capacity (hard disk space :computer:) and a capstone through which I could revise and apply current knowledge would be good as well. With these considerations, I searched for and decided on datasets for topics 3 & 4. 

1. Drone identification and classification (Kaggle dataset); amateur drones are used for recreational purposes. However, the misuse of such drones could lead to public nuisance :cop: and potentially endanger others. Timely identification and classification of amateur drones could assist authorities in forensic investigations and persecution of offenders. Relatively low levels of activity for dataset could indicate the range and depth of dataset is not sufficient  for use.
2. Foliage Disease classification (Kaggle dataset); the ability to help classify presence of foliage disease in crops (apple trees :apple: in the dataset) could assist in the timely prevention of mass disease outbreak, thereby improving crop yield and reduction of economical loss. Such a classifier model deployed in drones could benefit plantation owners. Dataset is locked (competition), and may not e available post-competition.
3. Global Terrorism Database (Kaggle dataset); insights from dataset may provide or augment counter terrorism intelligence :satellite:. The ability to predict expected casualties or classify type of terrorist activity given the available set of data could be useful to authorities in formulating counter-terrorist strategies, thereby potentially reducing or averting terrorist attacks on innocent lives and properties. 
4. U.S. Traffic Accident Database (Kaggle dataset); insights from accident dataset :car: may help uncover exacerbating factors leading to accidents, such as weather, road conditions or low light conditions. A machine learning could help predict and classify severity of accident, given a set of conditions. Insights from EDA and model predictions could be used to help authorities to enhance road safety by road re-design, etc.

## Guidelines: Points for lightning talk

For our purposes, a lightning talk is a talk lasting **no more than five minutes**, in which you will discuss the following about your three proposed projects:

1. What is your problem statement?  What will you actually be doing?
2. Who is your audience?  Why will they care?
3. What is your success metric?  How will you know if you are actually solving the problem in a useful way?
4. What is your data source?  What format is your data in?  How much cleaning and munging will be required?
5. What are potential challenges or obstacles and how will you mitigate them?
6. Is this a reasonable project given the time constraints that you have?
